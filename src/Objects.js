    desc : `Even the strongest people can struggle with setting (and maintaining) boundaries — so, if this is you, fret not.
    
    I believe that we crave connection, acceptance, friendship, love, intimacy…and sometimes we let that craving make us forget what we deserve.
    
    Not only that — but that the people we’re experiencing these things with should be earning their place in our lives, not just having it handed to them without showing you the same respect in return.
    
    So — what are some green flags that a person deserves the space you’re giving them?`,

    smallDesc : "Teachers don’t do this by choice, but necessity — Whenever we have fire drills in school (and the Law says we must have them monthly) a student",
    desc : `Whenever we have fire drills in school (and the Law says we must have them monthly) a student invariably asks me why we do it. It’s a reasonable question if you are ten years old. Ten year olds actually ask more reasonable questions than adults. Fire drills are loud, disruptive, half-chaotic. The teachers yell at the kids to stay silent, stay in line, stay calm, even though nothing is actually going on but that damned shrieking alarm.

    So I explain that we practice for a possible event that might make us panic and do the wrong things and get hurt. Not stay calm. Not know where to go. Not leave the room.
    
    But sometimes another kid will then ask, “But why do we practice if we never actually have fires?”`,

    Now, most people can never escape the 9–5. (And just to clarify, it is 100000% okay to work a 9–5 if you’re happy with that. This blog is directed to the people who want to escape the 9–5 grind!) The biggest reason why they can’t escape the 9–5 is because they never invest in themselves.
    
    And if you didn’t know, the only investment which has a 100% guarantee return is investing in yourself. Period! What most people do, is they work a 9–5, party the rest of the time, and spend their weekends “resting”, or complaining about their life.`,
